binary tree has children and parent 
leaf nodes are the nodes which dont  have any children 

subtrees 


1-->full binary tree - every node has either 0 or 2 binary nodes 

2-->complete binary tree - all levels should be completely filled, but if last level is not 
                complete then all nodes of last level should be on left 

3-->perfect node- all leaf nodes are at same level 

4-->balanced binary tree - height can be maximum log(n)

5-->  degenerate trees - all nodes should be on left(skewed trees )
        eg 
         1
        /
       2
      / 
     3
